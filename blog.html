     When I think back about my childhood, many vivid memories spring to my mind. Some are pleasant while some are painful. Regardless of the quality I attach to these memories, they constitute the early experiences of my life and they help to make me the person that I am today. As I grew up, I engaged in different kinds of activities, and one of them is to play. Playing came in different form such as video games, outside and inside games. It all started when I was introduced to different kinds of toys at birth. I also had video games to help improve my cognitive, mental, and motor skills. I also engaged in outdoor games, the pleasure of outdoor games in all kinds of weather, getting wet in the rain or soaking with sand, can never come back again. The golden days were tension free and care free from all sorts of duties and responsibilities. Even the fights had its own charms. Each game played; each activity performed taught a unique lesson of life. Ironically as a child, I always wanted to grow up fast, now that I am growing and had grown up, I want to be a child again and relive everything. As a child, my father always encouraged the use of the web and brought me and my siblings a personal computer, he made us do a lot of research and made sure that we learned new things every day.  Well, it seemed frustrating at first but later on it made me realize the importance of the web, and I got really interested in web & technology development</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;color:black">In my senior year of high school, I conjured up an urge to start learning about web & technology development. I built my first project, alongside with my cousin, a robotic machine that could be used to ridge, plow, and harrow a farmland simultaneously. I also made some basic websites and became drawn to computer science by the prospects of being able to create a product that aligned with my interests in a short of amount of time. I learned as I went, and building the website proved to be such a rewarding experience that I was intrigued enough to give computer science a solid chance.</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;color:black">  After taking an intro class during my first semester of college, I was instantly hooked. I learned that computer science was so much more than my younger high school self-thought it was. I found it was less about having a natural knack for the subject and more about committing myself to constant learning.</p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;color:black">  Since I came back to college for my sophomore year, I have discovered an amazing community of professors and students to share my passion for the subject with. I have met driven, excited CS majors applying computer science to their own unique areas of interest. Linguistics, theatre, cognitive science, gaming ...name a major and it’s highly probable that a Lincoln student is finding a way to apply computer science to it. My time thus far as a computer science major has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my college career and I feel like I have just scratched the surface. I am so excited by where it will take me. </p>
<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;color:black">  In the five decades since, the internet has transformed human existence. From how we wage war to how we make each other laugh, it's unfathomable how much the internet has shaped life in that short amount of time. The world is moving towards an increasingly virtual world, and according to experts, that will come sooner rather than later. Within only the next quarter century, the way we search or use the internet will be considered “archaically clunky.” Rather, our digital presence will not be separate from the physical world, but ingrained in it. Information will be displayed, floating in the air; the web will appear in the real world, not just on glass screens; Gone will be keyboards, the mouse, and screens. The world in front of us will be a mix of reality and the virtual and, at times, it will be impossible to decipher which one is which. The internet becomes somewhat like electricity “an omnipresent utility,” something we expect to always be available and around us intertwined in our daily lives.” We all can see the changes gradually starting already as Meta (formerly known as Facebook) brought out a virtual experience for the re-definition of their company. </p>
	<p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;color:black">  Web design helps not just in starting a company/business but in the long-term continuity of the company. For a new company, the first publicity comes through its website most of the time. Within the digitized settings in business, your website serves as more than just an electronic interface. It becomes one of the first branding and marketing tools, particularly for startups. Web development professionals study the requirements and build the code. In the process, they optimize the business value of their client firms, offering alternative solutions. High-quality websites are needed to offer sophistication and aesthetic appeal, which have a deep impact on the thought process of customers. Better navigation and accessibility complement their efforts of browsing through the site. Web developers also collaborate with their clients even after the launch of the website. By providing after-sales support and maintenance, they help business firms retain the consistency of their services. Web designing is more of the foundation of starting a company or whatever, and for these reasons I look forward to being a full-stack developer.
